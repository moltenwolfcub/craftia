# Craftia for 1.17.1

### **This file contains both the datapack and the resourcepack so it should be put in both locations (your resourcepacks folder and the datapacks folder for the world).**

## **Datapack instructions**

If you already have the datapack installed on a world run `/function default:uninstall` before updating to a future version.

This is a datapack for the craftia group. There are currently 6 people in it including:
- WolfWing
- FlareFox
- Orecelot
- Aquallotle
- Dr Crimso Creep
- Potion Panda


To become one of these Craftians do one of these two things:
Firstly try this, run the command `/trigger craftia_tag_me` and it will make you one of them if your minecraft username is setup in the code.
If the previous method didn't work then you will have to have admin to become one of them. In chat run `/tag @s add ` and then the identifier for each craftian.

The identifiers are as follows:
- WolfWing = `wwing`
- FlareFox = `ff`
- Orecelot = `orecelot`
- Aquallotle = `aquallotle`
- Dr Crimso Creep = `drcc`
- Potion Panda = `panda`

Say for instance you wanted to become WolfWing you would run `/tag @s add wwing`.

Don't become multiple people at once as it gets weird with commands. Run `/tag @s remove ` and then the craftian's identifier that you currently are.

## **Resourcepack instructions**

This is required for all custom sounds, textures and items in Craftia.
The Datapack will still function for all players in the world whether or not they have it installed, however all custom textures will not appear so all craftia items will look like their vannilla counterpart.

This resourcepack doesn't change much in non-craftia worlds so you can keep it on at all times if wanted.

The few things it changes are:
- Carved pumpkins won't have the pumpkin overlay (For the hats)
- Shields that have banners on are more detailed (Credit to the Vannila Tweaks team for this! [Link to their website](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/))

### **This resourcepack will not work if another resourcepack that uses CustomModelData is installed at the same time.**
